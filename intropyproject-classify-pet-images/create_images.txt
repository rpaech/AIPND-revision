Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

Yes


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

Yes


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 

Yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: 

Based only on the images in the uploaded_images folder, the accuracy of the three models is the same; however, the performance of the 'alexnet' and 'resnet' models are better than the vgg model.

Using the images in the pet_images folder, there appears to be some trade off between accuracy and performance.   All three models were 100% accurate in identifying the images with dogs.  In terms of breed, the accuracy of 'vgg' (93%) > 'resnet' (90%) > 'alexnet' (80%). In terms of performance, the duration of 'alexnet' (3 sec) < 'resnet' (6 sec) <<< 'vgg' (38 sec).  If accuracy in detecting breed is required, then 'vgg' is the preferred model.  If performance is required, then 'alexnet' is the preferred model.  For good performance and accuracy in detecting breed, then 'resnet' is the preferred model.
